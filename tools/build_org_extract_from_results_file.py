Build a v_extract_recent_pom_org_data.csv-shaped CSV directly from a Profic
"Results File" export, instead of from the live database via
../v_extract_recent_pom_org_data.sql.

WHY THIS EXISTS
----------------
v_extract_recent_pom_org_data.sql reproduces one row per (org, submission
period) of household packaging tonnage, sourced from the real packaging_data
table. A Results File run already contains the same granularity of data
(per producer/subsidiary, per material, per RAG rating, per H1/H2 period) -
this script reads that back out, so the Profic scripts can be exercised
against a synthetic org-data extract without needing direct DB access.

WHAT THIS CANNOT POPULATE (left blank/'NULL' - never fabricated)
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Results File is a household-packaging fee-calculation run. It has no
concept of:
  - Organisation registration data at all: CH_number, Nation_of_enrolment,
    Enrolment_date_time, Nation_of_Compliance_Scheme_regulator,
    Organisation_data_* submission metadata, Single_File_Submission_* flags,
    fps/lps/fos/los filenames. (Enrolment_status and Organisation_soft_deleted
    are the exceptions - see decisions 7 and 8 below.)
  - Genuine submission history: there is no "first submission" vs "latest
    submission" concept in a single run's output - each output row IS one
    submission period (H1 or H2). So the first_/latest_ pairs of metadata
    columns are populated identically from that same row's data (documented
    per-column below), not derived from real submission history.
  - Non-household-facing packaging categories: Non-household drinks
    containers, Total Non-Household packaging, Self-managed organisation
    waste, Reusable packaging, Small organisation packaging - all, and
    Transitional organisation packaging - all. This file only calculates
    the household-waste disposal-fee obligation; those categories belong to
    a different (organisation-level) reporting obligation not present here.
  - The Plastic-Rigid / Plastic-Flexible sub-split: the raw H1/H2 sections
    only carry a single undifferentiated "Plastic" tonnage.
  - "(No.Units)" unit-count columns for drinks containers: the file only
    ever reports weights (tonnes), never unit counts.

KEY DESIGN DECISIONS (agreed in conversation, 2026-07-30)
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. Two output rows per (producer, subsidiary): one for the "H1 Packaging
   Data - Submitted & Projected" section, one for "H2 Packaging Data -
   Submitted & Projected". This is not "splitting" a combined figure - the
   Results File already keeps H1 and H2 as separate per-period tables; we
   just emit each as its own synthetic org-data row, tagged with that
   period's code.

2. RAG tonnage columns are taken AS REPORTED, from the plain (non-Projected,
   non-defaulted) columns of each period's own section:
     Total Household packaging-X          <- "Household Packaging Tonnage"
     Total Household packaging-X RAM R    <- "Household Red Material Tonnage"
     Total Household packaging-X RAM G    <- "Household Green Material Tonnage"
     Total Household packaging-X RAM A    <- "Household Amber Material Tonnage"
     (+ RAM-M / R-M / G-M / A-M from the "* Medical Material Tonnage" cols)
   RAM / RAM-M totals are computed as the sum of their R/G/A parts.
   We deliberately do NOT fold "Tonnage Without RAM(Defaulted to Red)" (H2)
   or use the "Projected <Material> Breakdown" block (H1) - those are the
   CALCULATOR's output after defaulting unrated tonnage to Red, not the
   input. Per the user: report the input; unrated tonnage is left as a
   genuine gap (RAM-sum < Total for that row), exactly like the real
   packaging_data extract's own RAM pivot (which is SUM(weight WHERE
   ram_rag_rating IS NOT NULL) - i.e. it excludes unrated rows too).

3. Fields that only exist as an ANNUAL (H1+H2 combined) figure in the
   Results File - Self-managed consumer waste, sourced from the
   "Calculation Result" section's per-material "Self Managed Consumer
   Waste Tonnage" - are attributed 100% to the H2 row and 0 to the H1 row.
   This is a deliberate simplification (agreed answer), not a derivation.

3b. The H1/H2 "Packaging Data - Submitted & Projected" sections are NOT a
    full per-producer dump - they only exist as an audit trail for
    producers who had at least one blank/unrated material in either
    period. A producer whose H1 and H2 submissions were both fully RAG-
    rated for every material never appears in either section at all (of
    ~4,300 producers in Calculation Result, only ~1,950 show up in H1/H2 -
    confirmed by set-difference against the Results File used to build
    this script). For that "calc-only" majority we have no per-period, no
    per-RAG-category data whatsoever - only the annual Calculation Result
    total. Per the same "SMCW" principle as (3): the household/public-bin
    TOTAL tonnage (Total Household packaging-X / Public binned-X /
    Household drinks containers-Glass) is taken from Calculation Result
    and attributed 100% to the H2 row, 0 to H1. The RAM/RAM-M/R/G/A
    breakdown columns are left BLANK (not derived) for these producers -
    Calculation Result's own Red/Amber/Green figures already have any
    unrated tonnage defaulted into Red (same "output of blank processing"
    problem as decision 2), so reusing them here would silently violate
    the "report the input, not the defaulted output" rule. We simply don't
    have the input for these producers.

4. Org_ID = Subsidiary ID when present, else Producer ID (each subsidiary is
   its own org-data entity). Org_name is looked up from the "Calculation
   Result" section's "Producer / Subsidiary Name" column for that exact
   (Producer ID, Subsidiary ID) pair.

5. organisation_size is assumed 'L' throughout: this Results File / the SQL
   it was built to match is explicitly Large-producer-only
   (v_extract_recent_pom_org_data.sql: "client only uses Large producer
   data"). Not derived from any per-row signal.

6. Reporting_Year = the period's calendar year + 1 (matches
   v_extract_recent_pom_org_data.sql's POM_With_Year: "submission year + 1
   is the obligation year").

7. Enrolment_status is assumed 'Approved' throughout: only producers whose
   registration has been approved get processed into this Results File at
   all (per user confirmation), so every producer we can output a row for
   qualifies. Not derived from any per-row signal, but a safe inference
   from the fact that the row exists in the file at all.

8. Organisation_soft_deleted is assumed '0' throughout, for the same
   reason as (7): a soft-deleted organisation would never have made it
   into a live calculation run, so its mere presence in the Results File
   implies it isn't soft-deleted. Not derived from any per-row signal, but
   the same "presence implies status" inference as Enrolment_status.

9. Nation_of_enrolment is NOT populated - it cannot be inferred from
   anything in the Results File. The only per-nation figures in the file
   (the "England/Wales/Scotland/Northern Ireland with Bad Debt Provision"
   columns in Calculation Result) are each producer's disposal fee split
   across all four nations using the SAME fixed LAPCAP apportionment
   percentage from the "1 Country Apportionment %s" table at the top of
   the file (verified: e.g. two different producers' Aluminium England/
   Wales fee figures are both in exactly the 17.24%/27.59% ratio set
   globally for Aluminium, regardless of where either producer is actually
   registered) - i.e. it's a cost-recovery allocation, not a signal of
   which nation the producer itself is enrolled in. There is no registered-
   nation field anywhere in this export.

Sections are located by marker text and header text (not hardcoded line
numbers), so this should keep working against other Results File runs of
the same export format.
