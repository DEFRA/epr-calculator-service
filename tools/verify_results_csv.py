Independent verifier for an EPR Calculator "Results" CSV export.

WHAT THIS CHECKS
================
The Results CSV is a single wide export containing (amongst other things) a
"Calculation Result" table with one row per producer/subsidiary. This script
re-derives, from first principles, the figures in that table for each
Level-1 (L1) producer row -- i.e. the per-producer total used for billing,
as opposed to the underlying L2 subsidiary rows or the single "all producers"
grand-total row -- and reports any row where the file's own printed figures
don't match what the documented calculation would produce.

Every number used below is read from the Results CSV itself. Nothing is
recomputed from a separate database, submission file, or parameter sheet, so
this script only tells you "is this file internally consistent with its own
documented formulas?" -- it cannot tell you whether the *inputs* fed into the
run were themselves correct.

Every comparison is an EXACT equality, not a tolerance-bounded "close enough":
each recomputed value is carried at full (unrounded) Decimal precision through
every intermediate step -- summed, apportioned, whatever -- and only rounded
once, the same way and to the same number of decimal places the app's own
CsvSanitiser does for that specific column, immediately before comparing. The
app itself never rounds until the point it writes a value to CSV, so
replicating that gives an exact match rather than an approximate one; a
mismatch of any size is a genuine finding, not rounding noise.

For each L1 producer row, the checks are:

  0. L1 = sum(L2): for a multi-entity producer (one with subsidiaries), its L1
     group-total row's raw tonnage columns (Household/Public Bin/HDC/Total
     Tonnage, and their RAG breakdowns) should equal the sum of its L2
     subsidiary rows' own copies of those columns -- exactly what
     ProducerRowBuilder.GetL1TotalRow does. This is deliberately narrow: SMCW,
     Net Tonnage, price and fee columns are computed once at the L1 (group)
     level rather than summed from L2, and are NOT checked against a sum of
     L2 (the source code itself documents them as "not derivable by summing
     L2 values") -- doing so would produce false positives, not real findings.

  1. Modulation pricing (run-wide, checked once): the "Modulation Calculation"
     section derives a Red and Green disposal-cost-per-tonne for each
     material from a single Amber ("flat") price plus a Red Modulation
     Factor. We recompute the Green Modulation Factor and the per-material
     Red/Green prices from that section's own printed intermediate figures,
     and separately confirm that section's starting tonnage figures equal
     the sum of every L1 producer's own Net Tonnage plus the Late Reporting
     Tonnage parameter -- tying the run-wide pricing back to the same
     per-producer data checked in step 2, rather than trusting it in isolation.

  2. Section 1 -- LA Disposal Fee: for each material, the producer's own
     "Net Tonnage" (Red/Amber/Green) is multiplied by that material's
     Red/Amber/Green price-per-tonne (from check 1), bad debt provision is
     added, and the result is apportioned across England/Wales/Scotland/
     Northern Ireland. We recompute this per material and re-sum it to the
     producer's Section-1 total. This also replicates the app's zero-override
     guard (a material's fee is forced to zero if self-managed consumer
     waste tonnage exceeds raw reported tonnage): for a multi-entity producer
     that comparison is against group-level, summed-across-L2 figures, but
     the app prints those already-aggregated figures directly on the L1 row
     itself (ProducerRowBuilder.GetL1TotalRow), so no L2 data is needed to
     replicate it for single-entity or multi-entity producers alike.

  3. Sections 2a/2b/2c -- Comms Costs: 2a multiplies the producer's raw
     reported tonnage by a per-material comms price; 2b and 2c apportion the
     run-wide UK-wide and by-country comms cost totals to the producer by its
     share of all producers' tonnage. All three add bad debt provision and
     apportion by country (2a and 2b via the 1+4 apportionment, 2c via the
     raw by-country split), using the "Parameters - Comms Costs" section's
     own printed price/cost figures as inputs.

  4. Sections 3/4/5 -- SA Operating Costs, LA Data Prep Costs, SA Set Up
     Costs: each is a fixed run-wide total (from "Parameters - Other")
     apportioned to the producer by its own "Percentage of Overall Producer
     Cost for (1+2a+2b+2c)" -- which we also independently recompute, as that
     producer's own (1+2a+2b+2c) total over the run-wide total printed once
     in the file's header row -- then split by country (3 and 5 via 1+4%,
     4 via its own "4 Country Apportionment %s").

  5. Total Producer Bill: Section 1 through 5 (all independently recomputed
     above) should sum to the printed Total Producer Bill, both in total and
     per country.

  6. Suggested Billing Instruction: given the Total Producer Bill (with bad
     debt provision) and the producer's prior invoiced total, we recompute
     the liability difference, the materiality/tonnage-change threshold
     flags, the suggested instruction (INITIAL/DELTA/REBILL/-), and the
     suggested invoice amount.

SCOPE / KNOWN LIMITATIONS
=========================
  * The full fee/comms/billing chain (checks 1-6) covers L1 rows only. L2
    subsidiary rows are read for check 0 (see above) -- only their raw
    tonnage columns feed into that one check -- and the single overall-total
    row is read for context but not independently verified.
  * Requires a Results file that includes the "Modulation Calculation"
    section (i.e. a run using RAG-rating disposal pricing). Files without
    that section are pre-modulation and are not supported -- the script
    will say so rather than silently checking the wrong formula.
  * A one-penny mismatch confined to a single country's share of a Section 1
    material fee, where the country-apportionment ratio reduces to a
    repeating decimal (e.g. a split that's some multiple of ninths, common
    in hand-built test data with round GBP figures), can be a genuine
    infinite-precision tie: the true mathematical answer lands exactly on a
    2dp rounding boundary, but the app's own decimal arithmetic -- which,
    like any fixed-precision arithmetic, must truncate a non-terminating
    division somewhere -- can settle a hair to one side of that tie rather
    than the other. This script computes the true (untruncated) answer and
    reports the app's figure as a discrepancy when they disagree, which is
    correct behaviour -- but if you hit exactly this pattern (1p, one
    country, an apportionment ratio that doesn't terminate in decimal), it's
    worth checking whether that's the explanation before assuming a logic
    bug. It never affects totals, only a per-country split.
